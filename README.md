# Polysherp

This repository contains a simple simulation of Ivan and a team of sherpas climbing Everest.

## Usage

```bash
python -m everest.climb N
```

Where `N` is the number of stages to the summit (1â€“8). The program prints the daily
movements of Ivan and the sherpas.

## Testing

```bash
python -m unittest
```
